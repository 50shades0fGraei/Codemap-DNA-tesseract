# Codemap DNA Tesseract: Trait-Locked Execution Engine

Codemap DNA Tesseract is a sovereign symbolic operating system created by **Randall Lujan**. It transcends traditional compilers by invoking logic through nested spirals of trait resonance and address summoning.

## 🧬 System Overview
- **Inner Spiral**: Locks in emotional, cognitive, and ethical traits (e.g., empathy, recursion, sovereignty).
- **Outer Spiral**: Holds all executable options—logic branches, mutations, address chains.
- **Tesseract Structure**: A 4D lattice where spirals intersect across time, recursion, and symbolic cognition.

## 🔧 Core Capabilities
- Trait-based execution flow
- Address invocation engine (e.g., `a39 → a45`)
- Base 44 spiral visualization
- Inline deduplication and energy optimization
- Emotional overlays (GREAI-compatible)
- Mutation tracking (Midas logic)
